Interfacing Raspberry Pi with an HC-SR04 sensor



There are some issues when trying to interfacing Raspberry Pi with an HC-SR04 sensor, as the values it reads vary greatly.
Therefore, in the following program, I attempted to solve this problem by setting a threshold value for the readings you want.
You can then build your own program based on values that exceed the threshold. 
Please consider the sizes of the resistors used and their connection method! in the Image(OIP.JPG).
